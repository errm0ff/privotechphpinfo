                    <h2>Introduction to AI in Modern Business</h2>
                    <p>Artificial Intelligence has evolved from a theoretical concept to a practical tool that's revolutionizing how businesses operate. From automating routine tasks to providing deep insights through data analysis, AI is becoming an integral part of modern business strategy.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Key Areas Where AI is Making an Impact</h2>
